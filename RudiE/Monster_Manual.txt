RudiE Monster Manual

--ADDED--
p - orc peon
        In every generation of Orcs, the strongest become Grunts, the wisest become Sages, and the
        weakest are to become the lowly servant Peons. As such, Peons are weak creatures, and years
        of abuse and submissiveness have rendered them cowardly. When they sustain significant
        damage or hear the cries around them, they are sure to run away.


--PLANED--
G - orc grunt, a relentless warrior
I - imp, a demonic minion
b - bat, the breeds here are not only blind, but seem to have gone insane
B - basilisk, a slithering creature that spits poison
